              It was in early 2013 in which I first discovered Bitcoin and read the whitepaper. It was then I knew that I was going to dedicate myself to helping spread the idea and technology, and thus the enormous benefit of digital currencies to the world.
I spent several years looking for an opportunity to contribute to the blockchain ecosystem spending time educating others on the topic. In 2017 I was given the opportunity of a lifetime to utilize my knowledge of blockchain technology, and experience in managing large communities, all using a new governance model. The democratic nature of Lisk’s DPoS gave me the opportunity to work with Stellardynamic to make a difference in the Lisk ecosystem. The first step was to create LiskUSA.
</br></br>
LiskUSA hosted dozens of meetups and assisted in co-hosting many more, consistently delivering high quality content relevant to the blockchain field. We also gave presentations at several universities including The University of Berkeley CA, which has one of the most influential blockchain clubs in the country. I did a combination of management, organization, and presenting at most of these events.
</br></br>
During this time I focused on community outreach, along with educational materials and presentations. Pioneering the Political Theory of Blockchain, which was a massive success in bridging the gap so new users could easily understand this new technology. I also assisted in developing and testing the meetup formula for the official Ambassador Program and then eventually becoming an official ambassador of Lisk myself.
</br></br>
I manage the San Antonio Texas Meetup group as well as my primary meetup group, in Miami FL, which has grown to be the largest Lisk group on Meetup.com with almost 500 members. I also helped represent Lisk at numerous events that I had the opportunity to speak with many programmers, professionals, investors, and industry leaders about Lisk.
